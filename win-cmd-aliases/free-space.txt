When you run Disk Cleanup following this guide: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/disk-cleanup-in-windows-10 after it scans the first time, immediately choose to include System Files so it gets everything.

In addition, I will give you steps to both free up space on smaller drives and perform version Updates on them manually by the most stable method that requires much less space than Windows Update.

First here are tips for managing smaller drives:

As more space becomes needed, you can move your Desktop, Documents and Pictures folders into OneDrive and then set them to On Demand so they reside in the cloud and only have download links on the PC:

You can also offload User folders (Documents, Music, Pictures, etc) to another drive you can install on the same PC (even in the DVD drive bay) as shown in this tutorial, which will not affect speed if C is on an SSD and the other drive is not: https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-move-users-folder-location-windows-10-a.html I would not move program files or speed will be affected. You could also install a larger SSD/HDD.


This should make enough space to install Windows Updates. But for now I'd focus on the latest Version update since successfully installing it will bring along all Windows Updates and also resolves almost all other problems since it reinstalls Windows keeping your files and programs in place.

Install the Media Creation Tool on another PC to create bootable media or download the ISO to stick or disk, transfer it back to the target PC to open the media or click to mount the ISO, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator. This avoids needing the space to download the Upgrade and it's staging files. http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install

If you want to wait a few more days the latest version will be released to Media Creation Tool so you can use it and be fully up to date by the most stable method.

Another option is to do the the best possible Clean Install in this link which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587

This will give you back all but 15gb of the drive.

There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest: https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/

turn off or block Updates if they are bothering you: https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/

If you want you can set a Metered Connection per the above tutorial, then when ready turn it off to install Updates. You can even wait until the twice-yearly Version Updates to run manually from Media Creation Tool which is a more stable method than Windows Update and includes all previous updates rolled into it. http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...
