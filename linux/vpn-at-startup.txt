1 - Use this to set up the VPN https://askbot.fedoraproject.org/en/question/10880/how-do-i-start-a-vpn-session-via-the-command-line/?answer=15623#post-id-15623

edit file /etc/vpnc/default.conf to contain:
    IPSec gateway vpn.ox.ac.uk
    IPSec ID oxford
    IPSec secret <OXFORD VPN PASSWORD LOOK AT https://register.it.ox.ac.uk/self/software https://help.it.ox.ac.uk/network/vpn/vpnc/index>
    Xauth username <OXFORD_USERNAME>
    Xauth password <OXFORD_EDUROAM_WIFI_PASSWORD>

Then you can just run `sudo vpnc` and it should connect, and `sudo vpnc-disconnect` to disconnect

2 - Use this to make it a service that will run in startup: https://timleland.com/how-to-run-a-linux-program-on-startup/
$ sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/oxvpn.service
"
description=oxford_vpn

Wants=network.target
After=syslog.target network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/vpnc
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10
KillMode=process

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
"
3 - Reload services
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
4 - Enable the service
    sudo systemctl enable YOUR_SERVICE_NAME
5 - Start the service
    sudo systemctl start YOUR_SERVICE_NAME
6 - Check the status of your service
    systemctl status YOUR_SERVICE_NAME
7 - Reboot your device and the program/script should be running. If it crashes it will attempt to restart



Extra (in the phone they ask for these addresses to connect always thorugh the VPN): 
To know the IP of the VPN address, run:
$ dig +short vpn.ox.ac.uk
163.1.94.21

or
$ host vpn.ox.ac.uk
vpn.ox.ac.uk has address 163.1.94.21

And the IP of the DNS server can be found in this Oxford IT link: https://help.it.ox.ac.uk/network/dns/dns-info
IP address 163.1.2.1 maps to dns2.ox.ac.uk.
